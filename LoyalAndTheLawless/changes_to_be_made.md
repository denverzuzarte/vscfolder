ok firstly make the window 10% smaller

also the sample board seems to have a few issues

use the old motion mechanics if you dont have access to that 
lets say a players coordinate is (x,y)
d co relates to a motion of (+1,0)
e co relates to a motion of (+1,-1)
w co relates to a motion of (0,-1)
a co relates to a motion of (-1,0)
z co relates to a motion of (-1,+1)
x co relates to a motion of (0,+1)

when s is clicked a player is given its player ability screen
for now make that screen blank

also remove the move limit for now


now add a entry screen 
allow to pick between Rules, single player and multiplayer
for now leave rules and single player empty

in multiplayer allow the player to enter and pick to be on the loyal side or the lawless side
once they pick a side offer them the player options of their side example loyal side will be allowed the war lord  and the other loyal characters aswell and the neutral characters 

there is no need to load the other characters just load them on (-5,0)
