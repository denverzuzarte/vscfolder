##### Notes v1.6
Peasant:
	Special changed to Torches
	HP: 5 â†’ 6
Blademaster
	Guard Stance: might change to sac 1 attack for -2 incoming damage?
	That feels like its more of a choice between dps vs survivability, and there's some decision-making in when you want to pull it
	Vs now where activating it is effectively like a self-inflicted *Lullaby*
	Maybe also reduce uses to 1 to balance?
Knight:
	Let the rally also boost themselves, at the cost of 1 use/game?z
Wizard:
	Fireball damage needs tuning
