Encounters are different 'gamemodes' that can be played. They alter the starting positions of the players, and the player motivations. They should have a minimal impact on board layout.

We want 4-6 different encounters for the final game.
Give each encounter flavor text to start.



**TDM**:
Simple team-based brawl. Players start at the 6 corners, each team's only goal is to kill the other.


**Capture the Flag**
One team has [item] on a tile on their side. Other team's goal is to go to that tile, pick it up (mechanically like Shield), and then bring it back to their side of the map without dying.
Teams spawn on opposite corners of the board. 


**Ambush**
One team has initial control over the full map, can set up defensive positions. Second team ambushes them, getting [surprise round adv? too strong?].


**Area Control**
One team is maintaining an outpost in an area, waiting for backup to arrive. They need to maintain control of the area for [6?] turns. [Needs more work! Very incomplete!]
