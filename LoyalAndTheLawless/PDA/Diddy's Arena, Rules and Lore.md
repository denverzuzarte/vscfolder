Throughout the kingdom, the rebellion has been raging, and both sides - the Rebels and the Loyalists - have suffered heavy losses. To avoid more needless death, the Pope has called together the greatest champions of both sides to clash together in a final battle, to determine the victor once and for all.

Pick your character from the list of cards, and place their token on a board. Your card will specify which side they fight on - Rebels go on the right, Loyalists on the left. Bonus cards, which you get from participating in the other stalls, can go on any side.

Each card has a two stats: their Health, in hearts, and Speed, in tiles per turn. Every card also has one attack and one special ability.

Combat proceeds in a turn-wise order, with each player getting 30 seconds per turn. On your turn, you can move as much as your speed allows, and make one Attack. You can also use your special ability - these are more powerful, and may require sacrificing your movement, attack, or both.

Walls cannot be shot through or moved over. Rubble is difficult terrain, and requires two tiles of movement to enter. Shields are collectible items, which completely negate one instance of damage - after that, they're gone. 

The goal is to defeat all the members of the opposing team. May the best team win!
