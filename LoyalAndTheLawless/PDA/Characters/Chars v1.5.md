  ##### Patch Notes v1.5

Warlord (Reflavoured from Knight)
	Charge: 2 → 1 uses per game
Croc-Man
	Spd: 3 → 2
	Bestial Leap: 2 → 1 uses per game
	[Smaller board, Cr's distance closing power felt too oppressive. Might be too weak!]
Arbalist: No changes

Wizard: No changes
	[Fireball could use a buff... but a smaller board is an indirect buff, so may not be needed]
Peasant: New!
Cavalier
	MC: Extra attacks only do 1dmg
	MC: Reworded to not be confusing as fuck
	[Was balanced earlier, but required smart counterplay. Can't be expected of players.]

Knight (Reflavoured from King)
Barkeep
	Mead Bottle: 3 → 2 tile range
Witch (Reflavoured from PD)
	Dark Magic: 2 → 3hp heal
	Dark Magic: dmg now doesn't have range restriction
	[Undeniably broken in the hands of a skilled player. Too bad we're gonna have only idiots]
Queen: New!
	No clue what to do with you



##### Warlord (Loyalist)
hp: **9**
spd: **3**

Attack: **Warhammer** 
	**3** dmg to a target **1** tile away
Special: **Charge**
	Sacrifice your movement and attack this turn. Instead, rush 4 tiles in one direction, breaking walls and hurting enemies in your path. Enemies hit take 1 dmg.
	Usable once per game.


##### Arbalist (Loyalist)
hp: **5**
spd: **3**

Attack: **Crossbow**
	**2** dmg to a target within **4** tiles
Special: **Steady Aim**
	Sacrifice your movement this turn. Instead, gain +2 dmg and +1 range.



##### Cavalier (Loyalist)
hp: **5**
spd: **4**

Attack: **Lance strike**
	**2** dmg to a target **1** tiles away
Passive: **Mounted Combatant**
	After using *Lance Strike*, can use it again against other enemies, doing 1 dmg instead of 2
	Every hit gives Cavalier +1 spd for that turn.
[possible nerf idea: extra attacks do 1 dmg instead of 2, but needed? Is annoying, but not op]

hp: **5**
spd: **3**

Attack: **Flash of Blades**
