**Scrap**
	Hunter
		Was originally intended as the 'Alt ranged char' to the Arbalist, but Wiz/PD/Geo/Bar all have the 3-tile ranged attack, and are more unique in their own niches. We... really just don't need him. It is possible to rework him, but its not worth it, he fills no niche.
	Geomancer
		Walls were too tactical an ability. It's *very* cool, but it requires too much planning and talking, really slowing down the pace of the game. Some level of tactical play is desired in this game, but Geomancer goes well past that.
	Summoner
		Similar to Hunter, didn't really have a niche to fill. Also, the summoning mechanic was too complicated and didn't fit well with the pace of the game.
	


Todo, for final version:
	Restore Wizard's Ice Walls
	Re-integrate Geomancer
	Maybe try having Summoner work out?
