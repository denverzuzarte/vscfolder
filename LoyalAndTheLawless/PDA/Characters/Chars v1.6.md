##### Notes v1.6
Blademaster
	Guard Stance: might change to sac 1 attack for -2 incoming damage?
	That feels like its more of a choice between dps vs survivability, and there's some decision-making in when you want to pull it
	Vs now where activating it is effectively like a self-inflicted *Lullaby*
	Maybe also reduce uses to 1 to balance?
Knight:
	The bog standard character... they feel like they have nothing going for them
	Maybe let the rally also boost themselves? At the cost of 1 or 2 uses/game?
Minstrel:
	Vicious Mockery time reduction needs tuning
Wizard:
	Fireball damage needs tuning
